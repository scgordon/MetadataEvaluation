    "Two flaws were discovered in the course of looking at LTER and other membernodes; LTER is actually made of many different and semi-autonomous sites, and sampling from the entire collection doesnt give an accurate picture of collection improvement as a factor of experience with the LTER Recommendation. To address this I have made a workflow that queries DataONE for specific sites and creates directories of records uploaded during a year. This way we can look at the individual site's metadata usage evolution with respect to the elements in the LTER Recommendation Levels and better address the question of whether a community can successfully leverage adoption of a metadata recommendation to promote robust and complete metadata records that achieve a variety of documentation needs. After talking with a data manager at EDI I learned I could identify records by site using part of the record identifier. While it may make sense at a later date to include every record that was currently in the collection for a specific date range, we decided to focus on \n",
