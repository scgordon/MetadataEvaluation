# Metadata Evaluation

This repository is the home of ongoing development on a Python 3.X module designed to ingest xml and create analysis ready data tables in csv using pandas. If the xml is in any one of 30 earth science dialects elements are conceptually crosswalked for direct comparison, allowing the documentation needs of many communities 

If you are new to Jupyter and want to explore the notebooks in this repository locally, use the wiki to get started.

[Get Started](https://github.com/scgordon/MetadataEvaluation/wiki/Getting-Started)

The tutorial notebook should allow the user to gain an understanding of metadataEvaluation.py functions used to create data products.

Link below to interactive webbuild of the Re3data branch of the repository via MyBinder which opens an Exploration Notebook to see some of the types information needs the module can fulfill.
