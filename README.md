# MILE2
Metadata Improvement Lab at ESIP 2
This repository is meant to serve as a way for lab participants to generate and share analysis of their metadata.
The wiki explains how to prepare your computer to run the analysis, or you can use the Binder of this repository:
https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/scgordon/MILE2/master?filepath=notebook/01Metadata2Data.ipynb
Metadata is uploaded to a service where it is transformed and returned as a data table.
these tasks are controlled by a jupyter notebook that then creates a pandas datatable for analysis and visualization all within the notebook environment.
