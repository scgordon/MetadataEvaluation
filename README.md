# Metadata Evaluation
Metadata Improvement Guidance at AGU 
This repository is meant to serve as a way for lab participants to generate and share analysis of their metadata.
The wiki explains how to prepare your computer to run the analysis.
Metadata is uploaded to a service where it is transformed and returned as a data table.
these tasks are controlled by a jupyter notebook that then creates a pandas datatable that can be used to create data products for a variety of analyses.
