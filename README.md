# Collecting and analyzing EML records uploaded to DataONE by individual LTER sites, 2005-2018
A repository branch to explore metadata in DataONE uploaded to the LTER membernode and created at the various LTER sites around the world. By organizing and analyzing these records by site and by year we can investigate if a community recommendation coupled with guidance and tools help improve the creation of new records for a metadata provider. This repository contains the solr queries and responses used to gather the metadata about the metadata along with the various shell and python scripts, excel files, and xsl transforms I used to collect, organize, and retrieve the metadata collections I wanted to investigate from DataONE. The process to prepare and evaluate the metadata are described as well

If you are new to Jupyter and want to explore the notebooks in this repository, use the wiki to get started.
